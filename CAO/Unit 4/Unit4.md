# Unit 4 - Semiconductor Main Memory 
### **Introduction** 
In this topic we're going to learn how the operation of main memory with the help of semiconductor takes place. Therefore for performing such kind of memory cell plays an important role as all the operation related to the Semiconductor main memory gets performed with the help of cell only. We can't perform any type of operation without the help of memory cell.

In this case there are two states for

State 1 is termed as the on state and state 0 is considered as the off state.

Semiconductor main memory can perform the operation of two types that is read operation and write operation.

For performing the write and read operation we have to follow these two diagrams.

1. Write operation

- While performing the write operation we first have to select the data that we want to store inside the Semiconductor main memory.

- Afterwards the data will get stored in the cell and notification of the data is given to the control unit.

- if the control unit wants to store the data then it will give the permission to cell. Then, the data will get stored inside the Semiconductor main memory in order to perform the write operation.

2. Read operation

- Firstly we will the send the data that we want to retrieve to the cell therefore the data will get stored inside the cell, cell will inform about the data to the control unit.

-  Afterwards the control unit give permission to the cell then only the data will get retrieved to the user by the Semiconductor main memory. In this way the operation of semiconductor main memory takes place. 

*Note* - here the write operation is also termed as set in operation whereas read operation is termed as sense operation. In this way the semiconductor main memory works.

### Error correction

The diagramatic representation of error correction is as follows

In case of error correction there are two types of error which occurs.

1) Hard failure - It is a type of error which is permanent these errors cannot be resolved at any stage, therefore such type of errors which permanently damages the entire system and the error cannot be resolved are called as hard failure or permanent defect error.

2) Soft error - These errors are those type of errors which are random occurring errors therefore due to this non destructive error no permanent damage takes place to the memory. Therefore such type of the concept which causes normal error and doesn't result in any destruction are known as soft errors. And these are random and non destructive with error correction type of error.

*Error Correction* It is one of the very important step while resolving all types of error in the computer system. This is one of the best architectural view that every semiconductor main memory devices can construct in order to solve the problem. This concept is termed as error correction.
