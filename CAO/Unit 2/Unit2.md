# Unit 2 - Instruction Set

### *RISC (Reduced instruction set computer) architecture*

RISC stands for Reduced instruction set computer this type of architecture of used to process the instruction set, this are the parts of work to be performed in order to process the entire work. Therefore for handling this entire architecture of the computer process is done by the instruction set.

There are 5 parameters for RISC architecture that are
1) Hard-wired Control Unit - Firstly the control unit will send the combine instruction set to the data path.
2) Data path - This will process the instruction set further. Data path will send the instruction set to the data cache.
3) Data cache - This will cross check the errors and if the error occurs then it will sort out the error and make the instruction error free, then the data cache will send the data to the main memory and the data gets stored.
4) Main Memory - Now the data from main memory will get transferred to the instruction cache.
5) Instruction cache - It is the particular arrangement which is used to keep all the instructiona in a particular unit, then the completion of the process is remarked to the control unit. In this way RISC architecture takes place.

### *CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)  architecture
*Diagram*
This architecture can handle one instruction at a one single time therefore there are 5 types of block which performs the operation on CISC.

1) Micro program control unit - Firstly the micro program control unit will store the entire instruction inside a particular block structure.One instruction gets taken out and sent to the control unit.
2) Control Unit - this will take out the instruction and start the processing on it. The instruction then sent to the data path. 
3) Instruction data path - This will create the separate way for the instruction. And then sends the instruction to the cache.
4) Cache - This will cross check the instruction and checks the error from it, if the error has been occurred then the errors gets stored out throw it to the outside firm, therefore the entire instruction will make it error free code by the cache block and the output is sent to the main memory.
5) Main Memory - it is the particular block which stores the output and reside it. Therefore after the execution of first block gets completed then the second instruction will follow same path. This cycle will go on repeating until the entire operation of all the instruction is executed.
This is one of the architecture in the field of CAO.
