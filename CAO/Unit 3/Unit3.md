# Unit 3 - Computer Arithmetic

## ALU 
ALU is one of the important part where the operation of the computer system is majorly performed. It performs Arithmetic and logical operations on data. 

In Arithmetic the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and the unit which performs such operations is called Arithmetic unit whereas logical unit performs greater than less than equal to and Boolean logic operations. This such type of operation is termed as logical operation unit.

The diagrammatic representation of ALU is as follows

Control unit is the manager of the entire structure of arithmetic and logic unit, it can perform the operation on the basis of three parameters that is

1) Memory

2) ALU

3) I/O unit

If the memory is available for performing the desired task then the Input Unit will send the data to the memory with the help of it all the input can occupy the memory and then it is passed to ALU. After the operation is performed the result will be sent to output unit, this cycle repeats until the entire output isn't detected of the instruction set. Therefore such type of unit is called ALU.
